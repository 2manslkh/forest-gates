## Playtest Feedback

5 playtesters general feedback:

### Alpha Test

1. It was difficult to hit on-beat. Threshold for a "perfect" hit was too narrow.

    *Change: Made the threshold wider for a perfect hit*

### Beta Test

1. Needs more visual feedback when attacking enemies. Unable to tell when the enemy hits player.

    *Changes: Add a beat bar to indicate when the player should attack to score a critical hit.*

2. Game is too short, needs more rooms to clear

    *Changes: Increased the number of generated rooms per stage from 9 to 16.*

3. Unclear of where move towards during the level

    *Changes: Added Visible barriers to prevent players from proceeding to restricted areas*
